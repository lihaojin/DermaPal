# Project - *DermaPal*

**DermaPal** is a web app that takes an image of your face and identifies the most prominent type of acne that you have. It provides a description of the acne, what causes the acne, and how to treat it. It also lets you know what type of product to use for that type of acne.
What sparked the idea of this project was our personal experience of acne. Acne is a confidence destroyer for people of all ages who suffer from it. Like many people that encounter acne, it was difficult to determine the cause of acne and even more difficult to figure out how to get rid of them given the many types of acne that look similar.
